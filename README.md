This project is about sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing techniques. Its purpose is to analyze the sentiment of a dataset or of a given text. This can be useful in a variety of applications, such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and brand reputation management.
I used TextBlob, which is a simple and easy to use NLP library that provides a sentiment analysis module.
